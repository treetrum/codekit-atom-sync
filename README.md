# Codekit Atom Sync

Automatically switch between projects in CodeKit

CodeKit Atom Sync Plugin for Atom keeps CodeKit in sync with your interactions in Atom.

___

### Under the hood

Anytime you open a directory in Atom, this plugin looks for a CodeKit config file. If one is found, the plugin will switch to that project in CodeKit.

If no config file is found, nothing will happen. You can add your current project to CodeKit by selecting `Packages > CodeKit Atom Sync > Add Project To CodeKit`
